				<p>Over the past few weeks, IO domains seem to be gaining quite a lot of traction in the community. They&#8217;ve been used by startups and various other companies for a while now, but today Google has decided to accept the domain as a gccTLD meaning search results won&#8217;t be affected by the use of the extension (<a href='http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1347922'>Read here</a>)</p>

<p>This is brilliant news for anyone looking to grab an awesome domain. I myself went on a bit of a shopping spree when I noticed how many good IO domains were available, purchasing both <a href='https://www.fine.io'>Fine.IO</a> and <a href='http://fry.io'>Fry.IO</a>. When you first Google how to register a domain with the IO extension, you&#8217;ll find the first result is <a href='http://www.nic.io/'>NIC.IO</a>. They appear to be the official adminstrators so there was no doubt in my head that this company would be able to handle my domain properly.</p>

<p>However, I would just like to put a word of warning out there: They appear to store passwords in plaintext. I had to change my nameservers a few months back. I wanted to change the password on my account as well so I thought of just asking for a reset. After I&#8217;d navigated through their rather cumbersome UI, I found out how to do so. I entered my email and domain and submitted the form (Note the lack of SSL.)</p>

<p>To my surprise, there was an email now sitting in my inbox glaring at me. It contained my password that I had originally used. Transmitted via email in plain text. No link to reset it either. Just a helpful note containing my password. This to me a glaring security flaw with the site. Your domain is one of the most valuable resources you have. What would happen right now if you lost your most prized domain? So please be warned if you are considering registering with NIC.IO</p>
